# double_circular_linked_list

This directory contains implementations and related files for a double circular linked list data structure in C.

## Description

A double circular linked list is a variation of a linked list where each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes, and the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions and easy insertion or deletion at both ends.

## Files

- `double_circular_linked_list.h` - Header file with structure definitions and function prototypes.
- `double_circular_linked_list.c` - Source file with function implementations.
- `main.c` - Example usage and test cases.
- `README.md` - This documentation file.

## Features

- Create and initialize a double circular linked list
- Insert and delete nodes at any position
- Traverse the list in both directions
- Search for elements

## Usage

Compile the code using `gcc`:

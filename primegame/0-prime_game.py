"""Prime Game: determine the overall winner across x rounds.

Given rounds with upper bounds n_i, players alternately pick primes from
{1..n_i} and remove the prime and its multiples. With optimal play, the
number of moves in a round equals the count of primes â‰¤ n_i. If that
count is odd, Maria (first player) wins the round; if even, Ben wins.

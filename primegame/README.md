# Prime Game

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of the "Prime Game," a coding challenge that involves determining the winner of a game based on prime numbers. The game is played between two players, Maria and Ben, who take turns choosing numbers from a set of integers.

## How the Game Works
1. A set of integers from 1 to `n` is provided.
2. Players take turns picking a number from the set.
3. After a number is picked, all multiples of that number are removed from the set.
4. The game continues until no numbers are left in the set.
5. The player who cannot make a move loses the round.

The program determines the winner of multiple rounds based on the rules above.

# Substring Project

This directory contains the implementation of a substring search algorithm. Below is a description of the files included:

## Files

### `substring.c`
This file contains the main implementation of the substring search algorithm. It includes functions to find all possible substrings within a given string.

### `main.c`
This file serves as the entry point for testing the substring algorithm. It provides sample inputs and calls the functions implemented in `substring.c`.

### `substring.h`
This header file declares the functions and constants used in the substring algorithm. It is included in both `substring.c` and `main.c`.

### `README.md`
This file provides an overview of the project and its contents.

### `tests/`
This directory contains test cases to validate the correctness of the substring algorithm.

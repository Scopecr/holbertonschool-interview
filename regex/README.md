# Regex Project

This directory contains code related to regular expressions (regex). Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing. Below is an overview of the files and their purpose:

## Files

### `regex.c`
This file contains the implementation of regex matching functions. It includes logic to determine whether a given string matches a specific pattern.

### `regex.h`
The header file for the regex project. It defines the function prototypes and any necessary data structures used in `regex.c`.

### `main.c`
A test file that demonstrates the usage of the regex matching functions. It provides examples of how to use the implemented regex functionality.

### `README.md`
This file provides an overview of the project and its components.

## Usage

To compile the project, use the following command: ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 regex.c main.c -o test
```

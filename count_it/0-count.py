Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).
Requirements:
* Prototype: def count_words(subreddit, word_list)
* Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied and a list of keywords. AKA you can add a counter or anything else, but the function must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
* If word_list contains the same word (case-insensitive), the final count should be the sum of each duplicate (example below with java)
* Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, and if the count is the same for separate keywords, they should then be sorted alphabetically (ascending, from A to Z). Words with no matches should be skipped and not printed. Words must be printed in lowercase.
* Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it appears in. java java java counts as 3 separate occurrences of java.
* To make life easier, java. or java! or java_ should not count as java
* If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, print nothing.
* NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are NOT following redirects.
Your code will NOT pass if you are using a loop and not recursively calling the function! This /can/ be done with a loop but the point is to use a recursive function. :)
Disclaimer: number presented in this example cannot be accurate now - Reddit is hot articles are always changing.

I'll create a recursive function that queries the Reddit API to count keyword occurrences in the titles of hot articles from a specified subreddit. The function will recursively fetch all available pages of results and meet all the requirements you've specified.

I've created a recursive solution that queries the Reddit API to count keyword occurrences in hot post titles. Let me explain the key aspects of this implementation:
Key Features

    Recursion: The function calls itself with the "after" token to get the next page of results, continuing until there are no more pages.
    Case Insensitivity: All words are converted to lowercase for comparison, ensuring "Java" and "java" are counted the same.
    Word Boundary Checking: Using regular expressions with \b word boundaries ensures that only complete words are matched (e.g., "java." or "java_" won't count as "java").
    Proper Sorting: Results are sorted in descending order by count, with alphabetical sorting as a tie-breaker.
    Error Handling: The function gracefully handles invalid subreddits and network errors.
    Parameter Management: The function's prototype appears to take two parameters, but it uses default parameters for the recursive calls.

How It Works

    When the function is first called, it initializes an empty count dictionary.
    It makes a request to the Reddit API for the hot posts in the specified subreddit.
    For each post, it processes the title and counts occurrences of the keywords.
    If there are more pages (indicated by the "after" token), it makes a recursive call.
    Once all pages are processed, it prints the results in the required format.

The solution properly handles all the requirements, including:

    Processing all hot articles recursively
    Case-insensitive counting
    Proper word boundary checking
    Sorting by count (descending) and then alphabetically
    Skipping words with no matches
    Handling invalid subreddits without following redirects

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the code in more detail?

I see the issue with the import statements. The test is checking if the imports are sorted in case-insensitive alphabetical order, and our current implementation has imports in the wrong order. Let me fix this:

I've updated the code to fix the import statement order. The imports are now alphabetically ordered:

import re
import requests
